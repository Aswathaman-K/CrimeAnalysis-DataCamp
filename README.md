# Crime Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing crime data to extract insights regarding the timing, location, and demographics of criminal activities. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, I aimed to answer specific questions that could provide a deeper understanding of crime patterns.

## Objectives

The primary questions addressed in this analysis were:

1. **What is the hour at which most crimes occur?**
   - I analyzed the data to determine peak crime hours, highlighting trends in criminal activity throughout the day.

2. **At which place do most crimes occur at night?**
   - By examining crime locations during nighttime hours, I identified areas with the highest incidence of crime.

3. **How can crimes be categorized according to age group?**
   - Although the dataset did not include age group information, I derived this category from existing data attributes. This involved analyzing patterns and inferring age demographics based on available factors.

## Methodology

- **Data Extraction and Cleaning**: The initial step involved gathering crime data and cleaning it for analysis, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: I utilized various EDA techniques to visualize crime trends over time and identify key factors influencing crime rates.
- **Data Categorization**: To address the age group question, I implemented methods to infer age categories from related data points, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis.

## Results

The analysis revealed significant insights into crime patterns, including:
- Peak hours for criminal activity.
- Predominant locations for nighttime crimes.
- Derived age group categorizations and their corresponding crime rates.

These findings can help inform local law enforcement and community safety initiatives.
